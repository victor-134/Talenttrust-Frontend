# Walkthrough - Reputation Level Legend, ActionPanel Hotfix, and Milestone Component Docs

We have implemented an accessible reputation level legend that maps score ranges to named levels on the `ReputationProfile` page and component. We also repaired merge conflict issues in the `ActionPanel` dispute flow to make the entire repository build and test suite green. Additionally, we created a comprehensive forms usage guide covering all form components, their props, validation rules, and common patterns.

## Changes Made

### 1. Reputation Profile Component & Helper Logic
- Defined the ordered reputation level bands mapping `{ min, max, label }` dynamically scaled to `maxScore` (defaulting to 5).
- Resolved derived levels when no explicit `level` prop is provided to [src/components/ReputationProfile.tsx](file:///c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Talenttrust-Frontend/src/components/ReputationProfile.tsx).
- Created a styled, responsive, and accessible legend layout utilizing semantic HTML (`<dl>`, `<dt>`, `<dd>`) and appropriate styling.
- Handled edge cases including fractional score boundaries (e.g. `2.5`, `3.5`) and invalid scores.

### 2. Page Fallbacks & Integration
- Cleaned up obsolete fallbacks (e.g. `?? 'Community Member'`) in [src/app/reputation/page.tsx](file:///c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Talenttrust-Frontend/src/app/reputation/page.tsx) to rely purely on the dynamic band resolver in `ReputationProfile`.

### 3. Unit & Integration Tests
- Wrote extensive tests in [src/components/ReputationProfile.test.tsx](file:///c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Talenttrust-Frontend/src/components/ReputationProfile.test.tsx) covering all bands, decimal boundary resolution, legend grid items, custom maxScore ranges, and accessibility checking (`axe`).
- Corrected and updated tests in [src/app/reputation/__tests__/page.test.tsx](file:///c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Talenttrust-Frontend/src/app/reputation/__tests__/page.test.tsx) to align with the dynamic band resolver and page adjustments.

### 4. Documentation
- Documented the design, bands mapping, calculations, and accessibility implementation details in [docs/components/ReputationPage.md](file:///c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Talenttrust-Frontend/docs/components/ReputationPage.md).
- Documented the toast system's behavioral contract (quiet mode, eviction order, action button, accessibility) in [docs/components/toast.md](file:///c:/Users/Hp/Desktop/16Grantfox/Talenttrust-Frontend/docs/components/toast.md).
- Documented the milestone creation modal contract, validation rules, slug-plus-timestamp id scheme, `onCancel` behavior, and parent persistence expectations in [docs/components/MilestoneCreationForm.md](./components/MilestoneCreationForm.md).
- Documented the milestone status filter props, `Active` status support, radiogroup semantics, `aria-live` result count, and `resultCount={filtered.length}` requirement in [docs/components/MilestoneFilter.md](./components/MilestoneFilter.md).
- Added a unified dialog usage guide covering `ConfirmDialog`, `ContractCreationForm`, `MilestoneCreationForm`, and the shared `useDialogFocusTrap` hook in [docs/components/Dialogs.md](./components/Dialogs.md).

### 5. Forms Usage Guide
- Created a comprehensive [FormsUsageGuide.md](./components/FormsUsageGuide.md) documenting all form components across the application:
  - **Shared Components**: `FormField` and `ErrorSummary` with full props tables, accessibility prop injection details, and usage examples
  - **Form Components**: `ContractCreationForm`, `CreateContractForm` (inline), `MilestoneCreationForm`, and the Sign-in form with props, field tables, validation rules, and complete usage examples
  - **Validation Utilities**: `validateContract`, `validateLogin`, `sanitizeUserText`, and `isValidStellarAddress` with API references and field-specific length caps
  - **Common Patterns**: form state management, validation on submit, error handling, repository integration, toast notifications, and text sanitization
  - **Testing Guide**: test file locations, coverage areas, and commands for running form-specific tests

### 6. Hotfix: ActionPanel & Dispute Form Restore
- Resolved merge conflict corruption in [src/components/ActionPanel.tsx](file:///c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Talenttrust-Frontend/src/components/ActionPanel.tsx) to correctly render the inline dispute form and its validation state.
- Switched focus deferral from `requestAnimationFrame` to `setTimeout(..., 0)` to ensure compatibility with Jest/JSDOM.
- Updated dispute-related tests in [src/app/contracts/[id]/__tests__/page.test.tsx](file:///c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Talenttrust-Frontend/src/app/contracts/[id]/__tests__/page.test.tsx) and [src/components/__tests__/ActionPanel.test.tsx](file:///c:/Users/USER/Desktop/Talenttrust-Frontend/src/components/__tests__/ActionPanel.test.tsx) to use the restored inline dispute form flow, making the entire repository test suite compile and pass perfectly.
